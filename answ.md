1. What is the Darknet?
The Darknet, or Dark Web, refers to a part of the internet that is not indexed by traditional search engines and can only be accessed through special software such as Tor (The Onion Router). It allows users to operate anonymously by encrypting their communications and routing their connections through multiple servers. While it has legitimate uses, such as protecting privacy and bypassing censorship, it is also commonly used for illegal activities, including drug trafficking, illicit marketplaces, and money laundering.

2. Is it morally respectable to use individuals (even if they are criminals)?
Using individuals, even if they are criminals, raises ethical concerns. While law enforcement often relies on informants or convicted criminals to gather intelligence and dismantle criminal networks, this practice can be seen as morally questionable. It can lead to situations where criminals receive leniency in exchange for their cooperation, which may undermine justice. However, if their cooperation helps prevent greater harm, it might be considered a necessary compromise.

3. Does the fact that he has been working with justice redeem the crimes he did?
Cooperating with law enforcement can be seen as an effort to make amends, but it does not completely erase past crimes. Redemption depends on multiple factors, including the sincerity of remorse, the extent of harm caused, and whether the person actively seeks to change their behavior. If Sam Bent provided valuable assistance in dismantling criminal operations or preventing future crimes, it could be considered a mitigating factor, but it does not necessarily absolve him of responsibility.

4. Pick one of the measures that he took to protect himself, did he violate any principle?
Sam Bent used cryptocurrency (bitcoin) to receive payments and convert them into cash, which led to his money laundering conviction. The principle he violated is financial transparency and legal accountability. While cryptocurrency itself is not illegal, using it to disguise the origin of illicit funds constitutes a crime. This violation falls under ethical concerns related to honesty and the responsibility to follow financial laws designed to prevent fraud and illicit activities.

5. If you had the opportunity to ask Sam Bent about his experience, what would you ask him?
What motivated you to start selling drugs on the Darknet instead of through traditional means?
Did you ever fear getting caught, or did you believe the encryption methods would keep you safe?
What was your biggest mistake in running the operation?
Do you regret your involvement in the drug trade, and if so, why?
How do you plan to rebuild your life after serving your sentence?
